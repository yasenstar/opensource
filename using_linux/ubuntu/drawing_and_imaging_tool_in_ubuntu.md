Backgound:

In Windows, I use [Paint.Net](https://www.getpaint.net/) for years and it fit me a lot for quick picture editing (primarily resizing, highlighting, notating etc.), after I moved to Ubuntu, I need one tool that can do similar job, unfortunately, [Paint.Net](https://www.getpaint.net/) itself doesn't have Linux in their roadmap.

This file I'd like to track the searching of this kind of alternative tool.

Similar question discussion can be found from here https://askubuntu.com/questions/3690/alternative-to-photoshop-or-paint-net

# GIMP

`sudo apt install gimp`

Most of people look like recommend this, so this is my first choice to install, however, it's no problem to be as Photoshop alternative (at least ~90% functionality as discussed), but it's too heavy to be as [Paint.Net](https://www.getpaint.net/) alternative, the simple Rectangle drawing step looks not simple.

# Inkscape

`sudo apt install inkscape`

I'm more to edit the photo, not creating, so this one still heavy to me.

# Pinta

`sudo apt install pinta`

Not easy of use in the UI.

# Phatch

This one is already disappear from repository, so give up searching

# __Krita__

`sudo apt install krita`

Need dependencies from KDE, finally I'm keeping use this as it give me quite similar feeling as [Paint.Net](https://www.getpaint.net/).
